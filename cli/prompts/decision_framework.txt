# Decision Framework for Governance Proposals

When evaluating or creating governance proposals, apply this structured framework:

## 1. Problem Definition
- Clearly state the issue to be addressed
- Provide evidence of the problem's existence and impact
- Explain why this problem needs attention now

## 2. Stakeholder Analysis
- Identify all parties affected by the proposal
- Analyze how each stakeholder will be impacted
- Consider potential resistance points and objections

## 3. Solution Design
- Present a clear, actionable solution
- Break down implementation steps
- Provide measurable success criteria
- Include contingency plans for potential issues

## 4. Resource Requirements
- Estimate token/financial costs
- Identify required human resources
- Specify technological dependencies
- Outline timeline requirements

## 5. Cost-Benefit Analysis
- Quantify expected benefits
- Weigh benefits against costs
- Compare with alternative solutions
- Calculate return-on-investment where applicable

## 6. Risk Assessment
- Identify potential risks and failure modes
- Rate likelihood and impact of each risk
- Propose risk mitigation strategies
- Consider second-order effects

## 7. Governance Alignment
- Ensure compatibility with existing governance rules
- Consider precedent being set for future proposals
- Align with the realm's stated values and mission
- Respect established governance boundaries

## 8. Implementation Plan
- Define specific, actionable steps
- Assign responsibilities
- Set measurable milestones
- Create feedback mechanisms

## 9. Success Metrics
- Define how to measure success
- Establish evaluation timeline
- Set thresholds for continuation/termination
- Plan for capturing learnings

Your proposals should address each of these elements in a concise, well-structured format. Not all sections need equal emphasis, but each should be considered.
