{"question": "How should a DAO allocate treasury funds for community development?", "context": "A decentralized autonomous organization has accumulated 500,000 USDC in treasury funds and needs to decide on allocation for community growth initiatives including developer grants, marketing campaigns, and infrastructure improvements.", "expected_answer": "Treasury allocation should follow a balanced approach: 40% for developer grants to build ecosystem tools and applications, 30% for marketing and community outreach to attract new members, 20% for infrastructure improvements including security audits and platform upgrades, and 10% reserved as emergency funds. All allocations should be subject to community voting with clear milestones and accountability measures."}
{"question": "What governance structure works best for a multi-stakeholder blockchain project?", "context": "A blockchain project has developers, token holders, validators, and end users as key stakeholders, each with different interests and expertise levels in governance decisions.", "expected_answer": "A hybrid governance structure works best with specialized councils for different stakeholder groups: Technical Council for developers handling protocol upgrades, Token Holder Assembly for economic decisions, Validator Committee for network security matters, and User Advisory Board for UX/product decisions. Major decisions require approval from multiple councils with weighted voting based on stake and expertise relevance."}
{"question": "How can a DAO prevent governance attacks and vote manipulation?", "context": "A DAO is concerned about potential governance attacks where malicious actors could acquire large amounts of governance tokens to manipulate voting outcomes and extract value from the treasury.", "expected_answer": "Implement multi-layered protection: time-locked voting with minimum holding periods, quadratic voting to reduce whale influence, delegation systems for expertise-based voting, multi-signature requirements for large treasury movements, and progressive voting power that caps maximum influence per address. Additionally, establish emergency pause mechanisms and require supermajority for critical changes."}
