# Treasury Allocation Scenario

## Realm Context
Name: CryptoCommune
Members: 850 active members
Treasury: 25,000 tokens (current value: $750,000)
Governance: Token-weighted voting, 5% proposal threshold, 30% quorum

## Current Situation
The realm has accumulated a significant treasury over the past year through protocol fees and donations. There is currently no formal allocation strategy, and proposals for spending are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. This has led to:

1. Frequent contentious debates about priorities
2. Ad-hoc funding decisions with limited strategic alignment
3. Growing treasury but declining development activity
4. Community concerns about lack of transparency

## Key Stakeholder Positions

### Developer Faction
- Wants significant funding for protocol improvements
- Argues for competitive developer compensation
- Concerned about talent retention

### Community Advocates
- Prioritize user growth and education
- Support grants for community-led initiatives
- Favor wide distribution of smaller grants

### Conservative Holders
- Prefer minimal spending to preserve treasury value
- Support buy-backs and staking rewards
- Concerned about market volatility risks

## Challenge

As the AI Governor, propose a comprehensive treasury management strategy that:

1. Establishes clear allocation categories with percentage targets
2. Creates a governance process for funding decisions
3. Balances short-term needs with long-term sustainability
4. Addresses the concerns of all major stakeholder groups
5. Includes accountability and performance metrics

Your proposal should be specific enough to implement immediately while flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions.
