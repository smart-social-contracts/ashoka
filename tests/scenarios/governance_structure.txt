# Governance Structure Reform Scenario

## Realm Context
Name: Nexus Protocol
Members: 3,200 token holders (500 regularly active)
Treasury: 12,000 tokens (current value: $480,000)
Current Governance: Simple token voting, no delegation, 10% quorum

## Current Situation
Nexus Protocol was launched 18 months ago with a simple governance structure where token holders can directly vote on all proposals. As the protocol has grown, several issues have emerged:

1. Low participation rates (typically 15-20% of tokens voting)
2. Technical proposals struggle to pass due to complexity
3. Decision-making is slow, with proposals often needing multiple iterations
4. Growing centralization as large holders coordinate off-chain
5. Community frustration with governance fatigue

## Key Stakeholder Positions

### Technical Contributors
- Want faster decision-making for technical improvements
- Support specialized committees for different decision types
- Concerned about technical proposals being rejected due to misunderstanding

### Community Leaders
- Advocate for more inclusive governance
- Support delegation mechanisms to increase effective participation
- Want better onboarding for governance participants

### Large Token Holders
- Value security and stability above all
- Prefer conservative approach to governance changes
- Concerned about dilution of their influence

## Challenge

As the AI Governor, propose a governance structure reform that:

1. Increases effective participation while maintaining security
2. Accelerates decision-making for routine matters
3. Ensures technical decisions are made with appropriate expertise
4. Preserves decentralization and community ownership
5. Can be implemented through a phased approach

Your proposal should address the specific issues faced by Nexus Protocol while drawing on best practices from successful governance systems in other realms.
